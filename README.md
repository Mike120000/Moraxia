# Moraxia
A programming language I'm working on :p

# Syntax
## Expression
Moraxia uses expressions to perform instructions. Each expression ends in a ';'.

**Examples:**
* int num = 5;
* array char name = "John";

## Data types
Moraxia has a wide range of data types, ranging from variable types to specifications about said variable.

**The data types are as follows:**
* Variable types:
  * Integer: int
  * Character: char
  * Void/None: void
* Variable specifications:
  * Mutability:
    * Mutable: mut
    * Immutable: immut
  * Singularity:
    * Single: single
    * Array: array

**Notes:**
* You can use the data types as follows:
"singularity mutability type"
* Singularity defaults to single, and mutability defaults to mutable

**Examples:**
* immut int x;
* array char text;

## Operators
Moraxia has a wide range of built-in operators and allows you to create custom ones(if they don't already exist).

### Built-ins
* Basic arithmetic operators:
  * addition: a + b
  * subtraction: a - b
  * multiplication: a * b
  * division: a / b
  * negation: -a
* Additional arithmetic operators:
  * modulo: a % b
  * integer division: a // b
  * exponentiation: a ^ b
* Logical operators:
  * AND: a && b
  * OR: a || b
  * NOT: !a
  * XOR: a ^ b
* Comparative operators:
  * Equal to 0% error: a === b
  * Equal to 1% error: a == b
  * Not equal to: a != b
  * Approximately:
    * Approximation in Moraxia is a little complicated. But to put it in simple terms, there are levels of it:
    * 10% error or less: a ~ b
    * 5% error or less: a ~= b
    * 3% error or less: a ~~= b
    * Custom approximation: approx(a, b, error_rate)
  * Greater than: a > b
  * Greater than or equal: a >= b
  * Less than: a < b
  * Less than or equal: a <= b
* Iterator-object operators:
  * Index: itr\[i\]
* Pointer operators:
  * Point to: *p
  * Address of: &p
  * Dereference: *p
* Iterator operator:
  * The iterator operator does what the name suggests, it iterates:
  * <iterable> is short for: "for element in iterable".
  * This operator can be used in functions:
  * Consider f to be a pre-defined function: f(<iterator>) is equivalent to: "for element in iterator { f(element); }
  * This operator has some built-in functions and names to simplify interacting with it:
    * args: This refers to the arguments of a function
    * name(): This function sets the name of the element as the name of a variable.
      * Usage(inside a class): func f(self, ...) { self.name(<args>) = <args>; }
      * The code snippet you saw does what you probably have guessed, it assigns each argument to its value.
      * Example: "func f(self, width, height) { self.name(<args>) = <args>; }" is equivalent to: "func f(self, width, height) { self.width = width; self.height = height; }"
* Class access operator:
  * This operator is used to access a class's initial values and the functions inside it.
  * Usage: 'self.x', 'self.f(8, 2)', 'MyClass.p', ...

### Custom
Defining custom operators is a simple process:
* Assume the custom operator is '#', it takes two integers and returns f(a, b)â€”an already-defined function.
define int a # int b { f(a, b) }

**Note:**
* The 'define' keyword is similar to a function, it can have multiple instructions and a return line.

## Comments
Comments are parts ignored by the compiler.

**Example:**
* \` This is a comment \`

## Assignment
Assignment is used to capture a space in the CPU for storing a specific value, called a variable. You can use data types to specify said variable's type, mutability, and singularity(as shown in the data types section).

## Function declaration
A function is a part of the code that performs instructions on several arguments and returns a value.
*Return lines* are the instructions that get returned, they don't contain a ';' at their end.
A function can contain multiple return lines through conditionals(e.g. if, else, ...), but once the code reaches a return line, it exits the function.

**Example:**
* func add(a, b) { a + b }

## Function calling
To access the instructions and return value inside a function f with specified arguments, you can call it.

**Example:**
Consider f to be an already-defined function that takes two arguments. Here, we'll store the returned value in a variable called 'x'
* x = f(5, 3);

## Structures
A structure is a bunch of variables/constants in one place.

**Example:**
struct MyStruct {
 int value;
 char* name;
}

## Enumerations
An enumeration is a bunch of values stored together, each one represents a positive integer starting from 0.

**Example:**
enum Message { Succes, Failed };

**Usage:**
struct Connection {
 Message success_state;
 int error_code;
}
